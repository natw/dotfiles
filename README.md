# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, the files with the dots.

There is nominally an [install file](symlink.sh), but I really can't imagine it being useful to anyone.
I don't get a new computer often enough to make it worth optimizing.

The bits one might care about are probably my [neovim config](config/nvim) or my [zsh config](zsh).
I'm trying to convert all the nvim config to lua, but I don't think I'm quite there yet.
The zsh bits are cobbled together over the years, without any themes or plugins or whatever.
